//Add an ObjectIdentifier component to each Prefab that might possibly be serialized and deserialized.
//The name variable is not used by the serialization; it is just there so you can name your prefabs any way you want, 
//while the "in-game" name can be something different
//for example, an item that the play can inspect might have the prefab name "sword_01_a", 
//but the name (not the GameObject name; that is the prefab name! We are talking about the variable "name" here!) can be "Short Sword", 
//which is what the palyer will see when inspecting it.
//To clarify again: A GameObject's (and thus, prefab's) name should be the same as prefabName, while the varialbe "name" in this script can be anything you want (or nothing at all).
