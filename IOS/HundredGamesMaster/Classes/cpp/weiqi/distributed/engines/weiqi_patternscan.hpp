/* The engine has two modes:
 *
 * * gen_spat_dict=1: patterns.spat file is generated with a list of all
 *   encountered spatials
 *
 * * gen_spat_dict=0,no_pattern_match=1: all encountered patterns are
 *   listed on output on each move; the general format is
 * 	[(winpattern)]
 *   but with competition=1 it is
 * 	[(winpattern)] [(witnesspattern0) (witnesspattern1) ...]
 *   and with spat_split_sizes=1 even
 * 	[(winpattern0) (winpattern1) ...] [(witpattern0) (witpattern1) ...]
